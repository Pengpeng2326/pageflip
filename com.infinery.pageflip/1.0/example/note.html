<b>Tips for navigation between views:</b>
</h1>
<br />

<ul>
<li>Swipe horizontally across the screen from the right to the left to go to the next view, and from the left to the right to go to the previous view.
<br />
Note: for views which capture the swipe gesture themselves, such as Ti.Map.View, Ti.UI.WebView and Ti.UI.ScrollView, start the swiping gesture outside of the touch area of the screen, i.e. from the black bezel area around the screen of the device to allow PageFlip to understand that this swipe is a page-changing gesture.  
<br />
</li>
</ul>
